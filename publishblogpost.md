As per the course outline, we were only exposed to the preconditions and chapter one of this reading. Though, there’s still a lot to unpack in these ten or so pages. Ramsay focuses on the idea of literary criticism, and text analysis in this reading, and this text analysis is through algorithmic criticism. Algorithmic criticism “proposes that we create tools-practical, instrumental, verifiable mechanisms- that enable critical engagement, interpretation, conversation, and contemplation.”, (Ramsay).  As we read through the preconditions he states that the scientific method is incompatible with the terms of humanistic behavior. Algorithmic criticism starts with a consideration of the ways that the scientific method has been abused in humanities computing. Throughout the first chapter, he discusses the way that text analysis has changed the way we look at texts, and how rearranging, and transforming texts can bring new meaning to it. I agree that text analysis, and algorithmic criticism can prove to be good for analyzing mass amounts of text. A quote that instantly caught my attention in this reading was recited by Roberto Busa, “The reader should not simply attach to the words he reads the significance they have in his mind, but should try to find out what significance in the author's mind. (Annals, 83)”. I find this intriguing because it’s extremely relevant to this course. As we read these texts, we are supposed to analyse them and try our best to manipulate it in a way where we can understand it and interpret it, but we never consider what the author is trying to teach us. Taking into account what the author is trying to explain to the audience, our minds are open to more possibilities and conclusions that we may not have come to on our own. With that, Ramsay states that we can finally understand the liberating power of the computer. Susan Hockey, author to a book centered around the study of literature also elucidates how the computer can be useful to the humanities, “Computer based tools are especially good for comparative work, and here some simple statistical tools can help to reinforce the interpretation of the material. They can provide concrete evidence to support or refute hypotheses or interpretations.”, (Hockey). This quote encapsulates the entirety of this blog post assignment. Using the voyant tools we are able to look at these dense readings as a whole, almost as if from the outside, and interpret the true meaning (or various meanings) of the work based on the correlations between words, frequencies of terms, and so on.

This segues right into the main tool we use for our literary analysis, Voyant tools. After inputting the corpus into the voyant tool, it’s no surprise that a book on text analysis would have frequent words like “criticism, literary, analysis, computer, algorithmic” etc. As we look to the line graph, it is very easy to tell that scientific, and text do not really correlate until around segment 5, when Ramsay explains how Busa transforms Thomas Aquinas work utilizing the practice of “deformance”. He uses statistical analysis, qualitative data, experimentation and observation, all practices focussed more in the science, to manipulate Thomas’ work into something new. As for the rest of the graph, the way that the frequent terms flow together indicate the core arguments is how scientific method is not compatible with text analysis.
Though not discussed in the first chapter, the practice of “deformance” is still relevant to this argument. In the preconditions, Ramsay mentions briefly that in chapter three a main player in literary criticism is the application of “deformance”, which I mentioned previously. I believe deformance is a very important aspect of textual analysis. I am a big fan of music so I tend to look into lyrics and see what the meaning of the song is, and try to rearrange the wording in hopes of finding a secret meaning amongst the words. Some rap artists use this technique quite a bit, where if you listen to a song backwards, slowed down, or sped up you will get a new meaning out of it. McGann and Samuels’ journal, that we also read in class, that talks about the “reading backward” technique, that was used particularly by Emily Dickinson; “Nonetheless, both critical and appreciative interpretation promote some kind of intellectual or theoretical agenda. Emily Dickinson's thought is different. When she talks of reading poems backward she is thinking of recitation, whether silent or articulated. She proposes that an intellectual "overtaking" may come if one recites a poem from end to beginning, last line to first line (or is it last word to first word?).”, (McGann, Samuels). Dickinson has an excellent point; when you reverse poems, or in most young adults’ cases, song lyrics, you can discover a whole new meaning that the artist is attempting to communicate to the listener. You may also find that the selected words alone can have a deeper meaning, or multiple meanings, given the context which could change while you’re rearranging and reading backwards.
In sum, I trust that the practice of literary criticism and text analysis will open doors to new understanding and interpretation. In an article titled “The Materialities of Close Reading”, David Ciccoricco makes a fitting statement regarding literacy in the digital humanities; “Whether our computers augment the texts we write (via word search, spell check, or thesaurus) or, in the strong sense, we augment the texts that they write (via programs that enable dynamic generation of poetic or narrative texts), we conspicuously partake in such cybernetic reading and writing practices. In addition, when our texts are works of digital literature, works written for and read on a computer screen that would lose something of their aesthetic and semiotic function if removed from their medium,  we need to partake in these interpretive processes in new ways.”, (Ciccoricco). What he is suggesting, is since we are taking part in the reading and augmented texts, we might as well be getting the most we can out of it by looking at the material in different ways. With this, there is no question it’s important to look at literacy in the DH at multiple angles, to take it apart and reconstruct it, because there is a lot more value to these readings than we can see at a first glance. With the help of the computer, text analysis tools, and deformance, the reader has something new to digest no matter how many times they read it.
